A game for learning the Major System for training your memory, in Russian

You can follow progress [here](https://lexogram.github.io/monika/).

## The Major System
The [Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system) is a mnemonic technique for remembering numbers. It associates each digit with one or more consonants. By adding vowels wherever you like, you can create words that are easier to remember than the original number. You can then use these words as "pegs" to [create crazy unforgettable mental images](https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do).

The Russian version has [two main methods](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Мнемоника#Методы) for mapping numbers to consonants. Monika uses a third method, derived from the two traditional methods. The motivation for  making these changes was to even out the number of words that can be used with each number, while maintaining a simple logic between the number and the consonants that it is associated with.

## The Game

The game requires no previous knowledge of Russian. Indeed, it is intended to be used by complete beginners to learning the language. Those who already speak Russian will find the memory aspect challenging, too. 

The purpose of the game is to provide playful repetition of the number-word associations, with a final challenge of matching every number between 0 and 99 to its associated word without mistakes in a limited time. 

Future versions are planned for other languages.
